* TODO replace direct epc calls to deffered calls

; Example:
; (defun test()
;  (deferred:$
;    (epc:call-deferred my-epc 'outgoing_requests)
;    (deferred:nextc it
;      (lambda (x) (message "Return : %s" x))))
;  )

* TODO take care about (read-only-mode)
* TODO *RB-Diff* mode! There is python code. But syntax highlighting is provided by diff. Is it possible to have python syntax highlighting there? How?
* TODO so, now dates in reviewboard.py converts by means of dateutil.parser.parse. /How/ to avoid this dependency?
* TODO
